I came across the need to add latex in the markdown file as I was writting up one of the projects that I've done. As I was searching in the internet for solutions, I came across a simple solution in one of the discussions in stack overflow.

Add the following in the file `_includes/head.html` :

```<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
      tex2jax: {
        skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'],
        inlineMath: [['$','$']]
      }
    });
  </script>
  <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script> ```
