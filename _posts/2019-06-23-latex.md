## Adding latex to markdown

I came across the need to add latex in the markdown file as I was writting up one of the projects that I've done. As I was searching in the internet for solutions, I came across a simple solution in one of the discussions in stack overflow.

Add the following in the file `_includes/head.html` :

```
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
      tex2jax: {
        skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'],
        inlineMath: [['$','$']]
      }
    });
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script> 
```
  
Then 
```text
$$ Model 2A: Y_{ij}=\alpha_{0i}+\alpha_{1i}(x_{ij}-\bar{x})+\epsilon_{ij} $$
```

will become : $$ Model 2A: Y_{ij}=\alpha_{0i}+\alpha_{1i}(x_{ij}-\bar{x})+\epsilon_{ij} $$

## Adding back to top scroll in posts

I noticed that some posts are quite lengthy, wanted to add a link for back to top.
