## First post!
Been wanting to create my own portforlio ever since coming back to school to study statistics. Finally in this winter break, after days of exploring through the internet, this webpage is created. During my studies here in the U.S., I have been overwhelmed by all the interesting courses. Hope to share with everyone the projects that I've done so far, both projects that I'm doing myself and course projects that I find interesting :))

I hope who ever reads it finds them interesting as I do. I welcome any ideas/suggestions/comments :))
